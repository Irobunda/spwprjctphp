Chapter 1. <br>What is the object of these General Terms and Conditions? <br>

1.1 These general terms and conditions are applicable to all agreements you enter into with a provider of urban and regional public transport by bus, tram, light rail, metro, or regional public
transport by train. This means that these terms and conditions are applicable to, inter alia, your
transport and accommodation agreements with an urban or regional public transport company
and to all agreements that you enter into with an urban or regional public transport company in
relation to a specific product. These terms and conditions also include both your and the
transport company's mutual obligations with regard to the use of vehicles, stations or stops. The
terms and conditions are also applicable if you use a substitute vehicle operated by the urban or
regional transport company.<br>
1.2 These general terms and conditions provide you with information on both your and the transport
company’s rights and obligations. In addition to these general terms and conditions additional
product terms and conditions are applicable to specific travel products, e.g. season tickets and
discount products. In these product terms and conditions you can, for instance, read how long
your travel product is valid or when you can terminate it.<br>
1.3 These general terms and conditions can be changed. These changes shall only enter into effect
after representative consumer organizations have been consulted in connection therewith. As
the occasion arises, changes of the general terms and conditions shall then apply to all new and
existing transport agreements and accommodation agreements.
Changes of the general terms and conditions are announced on the websites of the transport
companies no later than one month prior to the effective date of these changes. If the public
transport company has a compelling interest in a change of these general terms and conditions
then a notice period shorter than one month can be applied.
Public transport companies shall make every effort to reach agreement with representative
consumer organizations about intended changes of these general terms and conditions. Should
public transport companies fail to reach agreement with these representative consumer
organizations, while such agreement had been reached on the previous version, then a note to
that effect shall be included in the changed general terms and conditions.<br>
<br>
Chapter 2. <br> What does the transport company offer you?<br>
2.1 The transport company commits to transporting you safely according to its published timetable
and shall endeavor to offer you a seat. Should no sufficient capacity be available in the vehicle
then the transport company may refuse to transport you. In cases of transportation failure,
outage or strike, the transport company shall be entitled to carry passengers at different times
and on different routes and/or to employ alternative means of transportation. The transport
company shall endeavor to inform you accordingly as soon as possible, and to, where possible,
inform you of the reasons, the measures to be adopted, and the potential duration of the delay.<br>
2.2 The timetable shall at least provide information regarding:
a. the days when the runs are available;
b. the departure times, the arrival times at stops and the times in-between.
The departure times of the vehicle from the point of departure of a route are determined based
on the transport company’s service clocks, or, failing the same, the timepieces of its personnel.
The transport company changes its timetable at least once a year, and in any case on the
Sunday following the second Saturday of December.
